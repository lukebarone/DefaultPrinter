Default Printer README

I - Introduction
----------------

I wrote this program for new systems running Windows 10, and having many printers installed. I am hoping that it is an easier way to choose your default printer, as opposed to the new PC Settings method, or letting Windows 10 choose for you. This has been known to be buggy in certain instances. If this is not the easy way of choosing a default printer, then I feel this has failed.

II - How to use
---------------

With the main window open, it should list all the printers installed for your system. Choose the printer from the list to be your new default, and use the [Set as Default] button. To verify that the change has been made, click on the [Open Printers Folder] button. If you made other Printer changes since the program openned, you can use the [Refresh List] button to reload the list, and grab your current Default Printer again.

If there is an error applying the setting, the program should self-recover without an error being shown. If you see an error, please submit a bug report.
